function obj = createObjFromTree(s, g)
%CREATEOBJFROMTREE creates an object from a tree-shaped struct
%   Arguments:
%   s - a tree-formed struct that serves as a template for object
%       construction
%   g - an optional struct with global parameters that belong to several
%       (sub-) objects.
%
%   This function creates an object (called root object) by dependency
%   injection from a struct that has a tree-shaped from.
%
%   The struct must have the following form:
%   An object is represented by a struct. The construction method for this
%   object is specified in the field 'method'.
%   Additional fields with non struct values represent parameters of that
%   object.
%   Additonal fields with structs as values, with one of its fields
%   again named 'method' represent more objects that are one level higher
%   in the hierarchy and that the object at the lower level depends on.
%   Those objects can be further nested.
%   Construction methods must take exactly one struct argument.
%   Construction methods may be class-object constructors (with one single
%   struct parameter).
%
%   Example of a tree-shaped struct:
%   root.method = 'ClassA'
%   root.param = 'someSimpleParameterOfClassA'
%   root.param2.method = 'ClassB'
%   root.param2.param = 'someSimpleParamOfClassB'
